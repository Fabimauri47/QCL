# calculator with complex numbers

welcome to the complex calculator, you can find different operation with complex numbers. that includes Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction, division, Modulus, Conjugation, Polar and Phase for complex number. Also you can find operation with matrix, For example you can learn about: addition with matrices, multiplication with matrices, transposed with matrices,multiplication of scale, conjugate of matrices, atttached of matrices, internal product of matrices, the regulation of matrices, multiplication with two matrix, tnesor product of matrices, the distance between two vectors and also you can learn the validity if a matrix is hermitian or united. 

# Objectives

The objetive of this libraries, the user can access of easy way of different operation that need. Also that the user can execute with complex numbers and also learn operation with matrices, where you cand find 15 different types of operation with this.


# prerequisite

the calculator of complex numbers, only the user can ejecute in PYTHON 3.6.2


the calculator of complex_matrix, only the user can ejecute in PYTHON 3.6.2


# Installation

You can install PYTHON 3.6.2, and dowload the next link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/

# Test with unit test
for use the test of unit test, its necessary that follows this steps:
1. its necessary that you dowload the archive in QHL, with name Complex number or Matriz_Complejos with unit test. If depend what program do you need.
2. when, you dowload the document, its necessary that you identify the different funtions that find in the document and choose the operation of the funtions that you need.
3. make the call of the funtions in the document complex numbers and run the program.
4. you can confirm if the answers is correct or not.
5. For test with other values, its necessary that you identify the funtions that you test and change the values that you want test.
